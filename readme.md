#### Running the FastAPI backend 
uvicorn backend:app --reload 


### Running the Front End

streamlit run app.py



To use it :
-Create Environment
-pip install -r requirements.txt
- run backend and frontend (note: wait for backend to complete setup)

1) By default I am using provided pdf at the backend as requested in assignment .



2) My output for RAG is not that refined (i.e the index range for response) and that's because I made only the protoype for assignment , if required will refine it later.
